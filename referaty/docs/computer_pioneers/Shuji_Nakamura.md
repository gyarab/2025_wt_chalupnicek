# Shuji Nakamura

## Greatest Achivements
Shuji Nakamura is a reputable electronic engineer in the field of semiconductor technology as well as one of the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Physics for the invention of "efficient blue light-emitting diodes", which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources in 2014.

In 2015, his efforts into the marketability and development of energy-efficient white LED lighting technology was recognized by the [Global Energy Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Energy_Prize), leading to him being awarded the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering in 2021 for "the creation and development of LED lighting, which forms the basis of all solid-state lighting technology."

## Career
Nakamura graduated from the University of Tokushima in 1977 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in electronic engineering, and obtained an Master of Engineering degree in the same subject two years later, after which he joined the Nichia Corporation, also based in Tokushima. In 1994, Nakamura was conferred a Doctor of Engineering degree by the University of Tokushima, earned through a doctoral thesis submitted by publication.

Nakamura left Nichia Corporation in 1999 to join the faculty at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Barbara) at the personal invitation of the university's chancellor, Henry T. Yang. Yang flew three times from California to Japan to recruit Nakamura, with promises to build research facilities and having a Japanese-speaking staff team assembled for him.

In 2001, Nakamura sued his former employer Nichia over his bonus for the discovery as a part of a series of lawsuits between Nichia and Nakamura with Nichia's US competitor Cree, to which they agreed in 2000 to jointly sue Nichia at the expense of Cree, and Nakamura received stock options from Cree.

Nakamura sued for ¥2 billion (cca $20 million) as his fair share for the invention, and the court awarded him ten times the amount, ¥20 billion (cca $200 million). However, Nichia appealed the award and the parties settled in 2005 for ¥840 million (around $8.1 million, less than 5% of the award amount), an amount sadly barely enough to cover the legal fees incurred by Nakamura.
